# Directory structure:

- Each file is named according to what it does, for example analyzer_notebook.ipynb performs tasks 1 and 2, rule_mining.ipynb performs task 3 and link_predictions.ipynb does task 4

- All the required libraries are listed in requirements.txt

- To create a venv and install the requirements, run ./setup.sh

- Then run myenv/Scripts/activate to activate the virtual environment after which the notebook can be run normally
